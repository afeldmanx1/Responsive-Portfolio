            <p>My life’s passion is technology and its universal versatility. Technology is an essential part of daily
                life; from the cell phones, we use every day to the robotics in medicine that saves lives.

                My background consists of a Bachelor of Science in Biology and a current employment as an Ophthalmic
                Assistant. With the difficult and fast-paced classes, including Calculus and Statistics, I have become
                a quick learner with a passion for diagnosing problems efficiently. I am good at analyzing programming
                challenges and working as a team to problem solve and develop new applications.

                From working in a medical practice, I have been given a leadership award for training new technicians.
                Additionally, the practice is very large and I have developed good teamwork skills and the ability to
                stay calm under pressure due to the fast-paced environment.

                Furthermore, I have experience with full-stack web development including HTML, CSS, Bootstrap,
                JavaScript t, Node.js, React.js, and SQL. My goal is to use my science background and developing skills
                in the pharmaceutical industry as a software developer with the integration of science and technology.
