            <p>My life’s passion is technology and its universal versatility. Technology is an essential part of daily
                life; from the cell phones, we use every day to the robotics in medicine that saves lives.

                My background consists of a Bachelor of Science in Biology and a current employment as an Ophthalmic
                Assistant. With the difficult and fast-paced classes, including Calculus and Statistics, I have become
                a quick learner with a passion for diagnosing problems efficiently. I am good at analyzing programming
                challenges and working as a team to problem solve and develop new applications.

                Additionally, the practice is very large and I have developed good teamwork skills and the ability to
                stay calm under pressure due to the fast-paced environment.

                Furthermore, I have experience with full-stack web development including HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Materialize,
                JavaScript, jQuery, Node.js, React.js, Firebase, Moment.js, and MySQL. My goal is to use my science background and developing skills
                in the pharmaceutical industry as a software developer with the integration of science and technology.
